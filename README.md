**Collaborators**: Mohammad Omar Sulemani, Mayank Singh

## Overview

The Intelligent Hospital Check-In project is designed to streamline the reception process in hospitals by automating the matchmaking of patients to doctors based on their specific medical needs. This system aims to reduce errors, eliminate redundancy, and provide accurate and up-to-date information, ultimately improving the overall efficiency of hospital operations.

## Features

- **Automated Reception Process**: Automatically matches patients with the appropriate doctors according to their medical needs, reducing the workload on reception staff and minimizing errors in the scheduling process.
  
- **Improved Scheduling Efficiency**: Enhances the scheduling process by managing patient flow and doctor availability, allowing receptionists to focus on other critical tasks.

- **Customizable to Hospital Needs**: The model is adaptable to the specific needs of different hospitals, considering variables such as the number of doctors, specialities, and types of patient queries.

## Technologies Used

- **Verilog**
- **Logisim**
